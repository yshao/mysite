<p>I received my training in computer science through Georgia Tech while a employed as a full-time embedded system designer and software engineer at Boulder Environment Sciences and Tech (BEST). The topics of health informatics and big data in healthcare would later brought me together with the researchers in neurology at MGH.</p>

<h1>Prelude</h1>
<p>Nanotech, Optics and Robotics</p>
<p>In my undergraduate, I was interested in everything nano, optical, abstract invariant principles of the physical world. The “goal project” was creating self-assemblying nano-fabricators. The possibilities at creating a abundance society appealed to me.</p>
<p>I had the fortune to work with a nobel prize winner in nanometerials, Shuji Nakamura, the inventor of blue LED, that summer was both fun and informative, as I found out how “wet” work is conducted in a fab room. I learned about van de pauw method of Hall effect measurement and a bit of crystal lattice structure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nnin.org/sites/default/files/files/2005NNINreuShao.pdf">Paper</a></p>
<p>For my undergraduate design project. I invented a innovative apparatus and electrochemistry process to create material for the characterization of laser beam profile with high purity silver. (95% and above, grade above sterling silver, which is at ~93%)</p>
<p><a href="https://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY06_07/erc_nano/YSHAO_senior_design.pdf">Paper</a></p>
<p>The silver helical target became part of the patent description in a laser characterization apparatus</p>
<p><a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/7609816">Link</a></p>
<p>I was also a mentor in FIRST Robotics for Team 159 at Poudre High School. I was also a former participant in the robotics competition</p>
<p>It’s one of the formative influences that led to study engineering. We won the Chairman’s Award for profileration of STEM for the state of Colorado and was one of the early teams that made the presence significant for the FIRST committee to form the Colorado Regional.</p>
<p>I’ve learned most about robotics here. The open-source hardware movement later made it cool to use arduino and rasp-pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Website</a></p>
<p>On team 159, I did robot and motor controls, electronics and was the original webmaster. I learned also machine shop related skills with metal and plastic. The new website is much more organized today!</p>

<section id="woodward" class="level1">
<h1>Woodward</h1>
<p>Right before I moved to Boulder, I had a gig working in the renewable energy initiative in 2008 on energy/gas/oil/wind turbine controllers. I worked on two different projects, Falcon and Eagle. One is for liquid valve controller, the other is for gas. The facility at Fort Collins is both the design center as well as the manucturing plant. The part I remember was it had a giant lathe that is more than 10 feet tall to machine the turbine controller in one piece</p>

<h1>Radiometers and beyond</h1>
<p>Right before I moved to Boston, I wanted to do something about the environment after reading about the pollution in China back in 2012. So I worked at this place that builds miniaturized radiometer, a type of atmospheric sensing instrument, that is 10-15 years ahead of its competitions. The website they run shows the amazing science this place do.</p>

<section id="clinical-data-animation-center---mgh" class="level1">
<h1>Clinical Data Animation Center - MGH</h1>
<p>I work at Mass General Hospital Neurology Department in a clinical data analytics group (CDAC - clinical data animation center) with PI neurologist Dr.&nbsp;Brandon Westover where neurophysiology/computational neuroscience/clinical science intersect. Working at CDAC gave me the opportunity to interact with physicians, postdocs, and biomedical analysts with specialized knowledge of the dynamical system of human brain physiology. Find machine learning/deep learning models that work well, it involves the curation of data to get concept representations learned from clinical data, forming a database of metadata. This compositional data concept system can be harnessed to build machine learning algorithms for many detection and prediction of degenerative states of the brain physiology and medical informatics. My typical projects involve wrangling multimodal data source ranging from waveforms like EEG/EKG, clinical timeseries like labs/vitals, sequentially updated physician notes, and preparing them into research-ready data through data cleaning, interrogating data statistics, rule-based label harvesting, data pattern classification with models, and discovering data correlation through predictive modeling and data exploration. Projects I have been involved in include but are not limited to - Prediction of the onset of sepsis with streaming electronic health records. - Large-scale visualization of Spatio-temporal patterns from seizure burden data. - Delirium predictive analytics on electronic health records. - Big data analytics on EEG processing. - Automated Surveillance for Ventilator-Associated Events.</p>
<p>Professional data science competition include this one <a href="https://education.dellemc.com/content/dam/dell-emc/documents/en-us/2018KS_Tony-EEG_Report_to_Recordings_Matching_and_Text_Mining.pdf">EEG Report to Recordings Matching and Text Mining</a></p>
<section id="large-scale-tsne-map" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="large-scale-tsne-map">Large Scale tSNE Map</h2>
<p>Working at MGH is such an extraordinary opportunity. The CDAC group has what would be the largest database of EEG showing interesting seizure patterns. A book that was published based on this work is now on Amazon Book</p>
<p>The earliest attempt to curate 100 patients was pretty challenging, since there’s a lot of data variabilities. Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>Visualization 1</p>
<p>The 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is fundamentally an inference and hard to get right</p>

<section id="sepsis-onset-detection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sepsis-onset-detection">Sepsis-onset Detection</h2>
<p>time-sensitive detection for near-time application</p>
<p>Predictive algorithm becomes policy relevant what it’s also predicting the onset, not just the category. This makes it relevant for interventional study.</p>
<p>This collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.</p>
<p>To train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition (published by CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.</p>
<p>The project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment.</p>
