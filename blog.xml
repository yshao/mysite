<section id="how-i-come-to-pointcloud-registration" class="level1">
<h1>How I come to pointcloud registration</h1>
<p>I’ve been working for many years, on a disciplined procedure for integrative merging between biomedical data and deep learning. To address this, I’ve been working with my advisor @ WPI to solve the fundamental problems that exist in multimodal dataset.</p>
<p>Since data preprocessing and analysis could take up 85% of the time, we find this an area of opportunity for practical optimization. For heterogeneous, multi-modal data, this challenging and time-consuming task shares the fundamental problem in registration. A common and similar use-case is the navigation of autonomous vehicles, from which multi-modal datasets are plentiful and far less sparse and hence spurred much progress in computer vision methods for multi-modal data.</p>
<p>Pointcloud is an N-dimensional dataset to perform research in multi-variate and multi-dimensional optimization. The bulk of my research is optimization methods on the registration problem - concretely, to improve upon the non-convexity of corresponding low dimensions, ie. the observational views of data. Since registration is a fundamental problem, it will show improvement on any downstream problem with any dataset, ie. domain adaptation, score ranking, tracking, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, I’m highly motivated to practical medical applications that could bring to data science the rigor of human reasoning and knowledge from the brain science/health science space.</p>

<h1>Algonauts 2021</h1>
<p>Due to my tangential exposure to neuroscience during my work at neuro critical care and infectious disease control. The summer after I started my PhD in Spring 2021, I was consecutively a student in the Neuromatch Academy computational neuroscience track, and then also a mentor in my home institution data science/neuroscience research experience for undergraduates (REU). I skipped the consecutive Neuromatch Academy deep learning track cause a brain can only handle so much!</p>
<p>The team I was a mentor of researched a topic on building correspondence between what the eyes see and what the brain sense, which itself is based on the Algonauts 2021 challenge. The overall ambitious goal was to link between multi-modal dataset.</p>
<p><a href="http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/challenge.html">Website</a></p>
<p>They won the poster award at Undergraduate Research Technology Conference (URTC 2021)! It was a great experience overall. I believe at least one of the students would go into Ph.D.&nbsp;program herself.</p>

<p>For my own computational track. I based my fMRI analysis on the Human Connectome Project (HPC). The work was done in collaboration with my neuromatch cohort that include researchers from Univ Virginia - A, WashU@St. Louis, MIT, Univ in Mexico City. This is a sample preliminary concept of an application. Research questions: “can we predict participants’ accuracy on the social animacy task from between and within network connectivity? can the prediction model improve its performance when resting-state-fMRI data is included?”</p>

<h1>Nanotech, Optics and Robotics</h1>
<p>In my undergraduate, I was interested in everything nano, optical, abstract invariant principles of the physical world. The “goal project” was creating self-assemblying nano-fabricators. The possibilities at creating a abundance society appealed to me.</p>
<p>I had the fortune to work with a nobel prize winner in nanometerials, Shuji Nakamura, the inventor of blue LED, that summer was both fun and informative, as I found out how “wet” work is conducted in a fab room. I learned about van de pauw method of Hall effect measurement and a bit of crystal lattice structure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nnin.org/sites/default/files/files/2005NNINreuShao.pdf">Paper</a></p>
<p>For my undergraduate design project. I invented a innovative apparatus and electrochemistry process to create material for the characterization of laser beam profile with high purity silver. (95% and above, grade above sterling silver, which is at ~93%)</p>
<p><a href="https://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY06_07/erc_nano/YSHAO_senior_design.pdf">Paper</a></p>
<p>The silver helical target became part of the patent description in a laser characterization apparatus</p>
<p><a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/7609816">Link</a></p>
<p>I was also a mentor in FIRST Robotics for Team 159 at Poudre High School. I was also a former participant in the robotics competition</p>
<p>It’s one of the formative influences that led to study engineering. We won the Chairman’s Award for profileration of STEM for the state of Colorado and was one of the early teams that made the presence significant for the FIRST committee to form the Colorado Regional.</p>
<p>I’ve learned most about robotics here. The open-source hardware movement later made it cool to use arduino and rasp-pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Website</a></p>
<p>On team 159, I did robot and motor controls, electronics and was the original webmaster. I learned also machine shop related skills with metal and plastic. The new website is much more organized today!</p>

<h1>Woodward</h1>
<p>Right before I moved to Boulder, I had a gig working in the renewable energy initiative in 2008 on energy/gas/oil/wind turbine controllers. I worked on two different projects, Falcon and Eagle. One is for liquid valve controller, the other is for gas. The facility at Fort Collins is both the design center as well as the manucturing plant. The part I remember was it had a giant lathe that is more than 10 feet tall to machine the turbine controller in one piece</p>

<h1>Spectra Logic</h1>
<p>I took a database design course when I was a sustaining electrical engineer at a company that builds scalable deep storage controlled by robotics. The database built was for PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) quality control. Assemblies made from off the shelf parts often have nominal differences, and for as precise control as robotics, these nominal differences transform into unique offsets and calibration. I compiled a research paper before implementing some of the idea into the storage media certification process.</p>
<p><a href="">Report</a></p>
<p>The implementation of this automation infrastructure became a business unit at the company. For this role product improvments, I worked across 12 individual departments and had groups of technical personnels reporting to me. The role was to integrate all numerous autonomous sub-assemblies from mechanical/electrical/firmware/software/service into a production line.</p>
<p>The software/system integration I did would integrate the disk library product into a hybrid system with the tape library product - the main offering of the company. The many subparts of the integration work involved communication between the robotics and the communication and control main board of the tape library unit. Therefore, I was automating work on the CanBus and Ethernet switch, as well as making utilities for functional exercise of the motors, scaners, media readers, boot EEPROM, etc. <a href="https://spectralogic.com/products/spectra-t950/">Website</a></p>

The website they run shows the amazing science this place do. The other form factors for remote sensing radiometer include land-based in antarctica. I worked only on the marine-buoy and the aerial instrument that was mounted on Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).</p>

<section id="clinical-data-animation-center---mgh" class="level1">
<h1>Clinical Data Animation Center - MGH</h1>
<p>I work at Mass General Hospital Neurology Department in a clinical data analytics group (CDAC - clinical data animation center) with PI neurologist Dr.&nbsp;Brandon Westover where neurophysiology/computational neuroscience/clinical science intersect. Working at CDAC gave me the opportunity to interact with physicians, postdocs, and biomedical analysts with specialized knowledge of the dynamical system of human brain physiology. Find machine learning/deep learning models that work well, it involves the curation of data to get concept representations learned from clinical data, forming a database of metadata. This compositional data concept system can be harnessed to build machine learning algorithms for many detection and prediction of degenerative states of the brain physiology and medical informatics. My typical projects involve wrangling multimodal data source ranging from waveforms like EEG/EKG, clinical timeseries like labs/vitals, sequentially updated physician notes, and preparing them into research-ready data through data cleaning, interrogating data statistics, rule-based label harvesting, data pattern classification with models, and discovering data correlation through predictive modeling and data exploration. Projects I have been involved in include but are not limited to - Prediction of the onset of sepsis with streaming electronic health records. - Large-scale visualization of Spatio-temporal patterns from seizure burden data. - Delirium predictive analytics on electronic health records. - Big data analytics on EEG processing. - Automated Surveillance for Ventilator-Associated Events.</p>
<p>Professional data science competition include this one <a href="https://education.dellemc.com/content/dam/dell-emc/documents/en-us/2018KS_Tony-EEG_Report_to_Recordings_Matching_and_Text_Mining.pdf">EEG Report to Recordings Matching and Text Mining</a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="large-scale-tsne-map">Large Scale tSNE Map</h2>
<p>Working at MGH is such an extraordinary opportunity. The CDAC group has what would be the largest database of EEG showing interesting seizure patterns. A book that was published based on this work is now on Amazon Book</p>
<p>The earliest attempt to curate 100 patients was pretty challenging, since there’s a lot of data variabilities. Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.</p>
<p>The 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is learned network inference and hard to get right since the map is keep changing on a large-scale.</p>

<p>time-sensitive detection for near-time application</p>
<p>Predictive algorithm becomes policy relevant what it’s also predicting the onset, not just the category. This makes it relevant for interventional study.</p>
<p>This collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.</p>
<p>To train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition published by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.</p>
<p>The project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment.</p>
