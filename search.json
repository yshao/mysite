    "text": "I’ve been working for many years, on a disciplined procedure for an integrative merging between biomedical data and deep learning. To address this, I’ve been working with my advisor @ WPI to solve the fundamental problems that exist in multimodal dataset as an abstraction.\nSince data preprocessing and analysis could take up 85% of the time, we find this an area of opportunity for practical optimization. For heterogeneous, multi-modal data, this challenging and time-consuming task shares the fundamental problem - registration. A common and similar use-case is the navigation of autonomous vehicles, from which multi-modal datasets are plentiful and far less sparse and hence spurred much progress in computer vision methods for multi-modal data.\nPointcloud is an N-dimensional dataset to perform research in multi-variate and multi-dimensional optimization. The bulk of my research is optimization methods on the registration problem - concretely, to improve upon the non-convexity of corresponding low dimensions, ie. the observational views of data. Since registration is a fundamental problem, it will show improvement on any downstream problem with any dataset, ie. domain adaptation, score ranking, tracking, etc.\nHence, from here, I’m highly motivated to practical medical applications that could bring to data science the rigor of human reasoning and knowledge from the brain science/health science space."

    "text": "GeorgiaTech Work in a 5 minutes video\nI received my training in computer science through Georgia Tech while employed as a full-time embedded system designer and software engineer at Boulder Environment Sciences and Tech (BEST). The topics of health informatics and big data in healthcare would later bring me together with the researchers in neurology at MGH.\nThis video clip was prepared as part of Ph.D. application demo. Video\n\n\nDigital Porfolio (in progress of update…)\n\n\nBig Data for Healthcare Analytics\nMIMIC3 readmission prediction\nThis class introduced many big data analytics methods as applied to electronic health records processing. For the final thesis paper, I researched the topic of readmission to the hospital after discharge. I harvested the readmission labels from the MIMIC-3 database and then prepared features from patients’ vitals, labs, and demographics. The readmission label criterion looks for people who came back to the hospital within 30 days, essentially discharged while their inpatient health progression would indicate for a longer stay. The RNN (recurrent neural network) model with GRU was built in PyTorch, and then again in TensorFlow. It achieved an AUROC of 71%. Though being a black box, it was not interpretable. From this project, I learned the importance of interpretability to make the model useful for advancing the understanding of healthcare science.\nReport\n\n\nComputational Photography\nCartoonize Me This is a fun class. After learning the basics of computer vision, this class uses the OpenCV and other image processing libraries to create effects on photos and videos. I also learned how to use an SLR camera, which is not easy to get right.\nDemo\nSlides\n\n\nHealthcare Informatics\nThis class introduced me to one of the components of cognitive reasoning - bayesian trees/nets. It’s a team project to stream the FHIR informatics to a zikas virus detection web app. The algorithm part I implemented is a simple bayesian network based on risk factors of the patient’s medical history.\nSlides\n\n\nHuman Computer Interface\nThis is a design class that involves designing interactivity - in terms of cognition, communication, and computing device, and where interface could exist. Part design, part philosophical. Part architectural design, part survey work. Half individual, half group work.\nOur team designed a paper for an app using the principles from the class and designs a mobile-app that encourages adherence to a healthy lifestyle.\nReport\n\n\nEducational Technology\nProject KnowledgeCog\nWith this project, I worked with an assigned advisor in the Educational Technology class to do independent research. I set out to research the methodology for building an intelligent tutor agent that could understand works of fiction and then assess and evaluate human users on their understanding of the readings. The agent utilizes NLP (natural language processing) to produce an auto-generated summary of paragraphs and link the sections of paragraphs as ordered concepts. The agent then presents the paragraphs to human users in order for them to put the paragraphs in order. From this activity, the agent assesses and evaluates the understanding of the human user. My mentor a Microsoft research scientist encouraged me to submit the report to Learning@Scale. This is an open draft that has not yet been submitted.\nReport\n\n\nCognitive System\nRaven Progressive Matrices\nThe first class I took as part of GaTech’s master of computer science degree. Turns out the ideas discussed in the class are much more than this introductory class could cover in a semester. I think cognition-inspired computation is really where it’s at for computational sciences.\nIn this class, I built an agent to solve Raven Progressive Matrices, which is a human intelligence metric applied to measure AI intelligence.\nReport\n\n\nComputer Vision\nComputer vision fundamentals\nOne of the first classes I took at GaTech. The instructor Aaron Bobick (currently a dean of engineering at Washington University) was just one of the greatest instructors at the institute. Really engaging instructor and pretty much like drinking from a firehose going through the class. The class covers fundamentals completely not including deep learning, hence would be considered “classical computer vision”\n\n\nMachine Learning\nWEKA, openai, R…, machine learning toolboxes\nThe first machine learning class I took as part of GaTech’s master of computer science degree. It covers all the categories of machine learning, supervised learning, randomized optimization, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning..etc\nI will find out later that there’s a self-, or semi-supervised learning that is a category of its own, too.\nWrote 4 reports, one report for each category. This class is like drinking from a hose with each report.\nReport\n\n\nMachine Learning for Trading\nTimeseries learning with robot\nThis class has timeseries, robots, and QLearning! (and Deep RL) There’s a section on financial stock background, and the rest of the class is about reading timeseries signals and apply data science and data modeling to do predictive analytics. A very practical class that introduced me to pandas.\nReport\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{shao2022,\n  author = {Yuping Shao},\n  title = {Graduate {(Master)}},\n  date = {2022-05-18},\n  url = {https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/graduate},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYuping Shao. 2022. “Graduate (Master).” May 18, 2022. https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/graduate."

Assemblies made from off the shelf parts often have nominal differences, and for as precise control as robotics, these nominal differences transform into unique offsets and calibration. I compiled a research paper before implementing some of the idea into the storage media certification process.\nReport\nThe implementation of this automation infrastructure became a business unit at the company. For this role product improvments, I worked across 12 individual departments and had groups of technical personnels reporting to me. The role was to integrate all numerous autonomous sub-assemblies from mechanical/electrical/firmware/software/service into a production line.\nThe software/system integration I did would integrate the disk library product into a hybrid system with the tape library product - the main offering of the company. The many subparts of the integration work involved communication between the robotics and the communication and control main board of the tape library unit. Therefore, I was automating work on the CanBus and Ethernet switch, as well as making utilities for functional exercise of the motors, scaners, media readers, boot EEPROM, etc. Website\n\n\nRadiometers and beyond\nRight before I moved to Boston, I worked at this place that builds miniaturized radiometer, a type of atmospheric sensing instrument, that in its aerial form factor, is 10-15 years ahead of its competitions. The website they run shows the amazing science this place do. The other form factors for remote sensing radiometer include land-based in antarctica. I worked only on the marine-buoy and the aerial instrument that was mounted on Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\nWebsite\nThe company apparently has moved to mostly satellites related sensing.\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{shao2022,\n  author = {Yuping Shao},\n  title = {Work {Experience} in {Colorado}},\n  date = {2022-05-18},\n  url = {https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/work-experience},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYuping Shao. 2022. “Work Experience in Colorado.” May 18,\n2022. https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/work-experience."

    "text": "I worked at Mass General Hospital Neurology Department in a clinical data analytics group (CDAC - clinical data animation center) with PI neurologist Dr. Brandon Westover where neurophysiology/computational neuroscience/clinical science intersect. Working at CDAC gave me the opportunity to interact with physicians, postdocs, and biomedical analysts with specialized knowledge of the dynamical system of human brain physiology. Find machine learning/deep learning models that work well, it involves the curation of data to get concept representations learned from clinical data, forming a database of metadata. This compositional data concept system can be harnessed to build machine learning algorithms for many detection and prediction of degenerative states of the brain physiology and medical informatics. My typical projects involve wrangling multimodal data source ranging from waveforms like EEG/EKG, clinical timeseries like labs/vitals, sequentially updated physician notes, and preparing them into research-ready data through data cleaning, interrogating data statistics, rule-based label harvesting, data pattern classification with models, and discovering data correlation through predictive modeling and data exploration. Projects I have been involved in include but are not limited to - Prediction of the onset of sepsis with streaming electronic health records. - Large-scale visualization of Spatio-temporal patterns from seizure burden data. - Delirium predictive analytics on electronic health records. - Big data analytics on EEG processing. - Automated Surveillance for Ventilator-Associated Events.\nProfessional data science competition include this one EEG Report to Recordings Matching and Text Mining\n\n\nWorking at MGH is such an extraordinary opportunity. The CDAC group has what would be the largest database of EEG showing interesting seizure patterns. A book that was published based on this work is now on Amazon Book\nThe earliest attempt to curate 100 patients was pretty challenging, since there’s a lot of data variabilities. Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.\nThe 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is learned network inference and hard to get right since the map is keep changing on a large-scale.\nWebsite\n\n\n\ntime-sensitive detection for near-time application\nPredictive algorithm becomes policy relevant what it’s also predicting the onset, not just the category. This makes it relevant for interventional study.\nThis collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.\nTo train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition published by the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.\nThe project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment.\nWebsite\n\n\n\nI was a organizer and main work leader in a series of workshop to introduce clinical researchers to big data analytics workflow. Work was in collaboration with Manohar Ghanta and Moura Valdery whom was a brain health contributor at the time.\nsanitized (deidentification applied) Big Data Analytics Workshop\nWorkshop 1\nWorkshop 2\nWorkshop 3\nWorkshop 4"

This should (hopefully) make it extremely easy to scale an analysis of HTE from the common single-outcome / single-moderator case to many outcomes and many moderators. The configuration of tidyhte should make it extremely easy to perform the same analysis across many outcomes and for a wide-array of moderators. It’s written to be fairly easy to extend to different models and to add additional diagnostics and ways to output information from a set of HTE estimates.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n    \nregweight\nThe goal of regweight is to make it easy to diagnose a model using Aronow and Samii (2015) regression weights.\nIn short, these weights show which observations are most influential for determining the observed value of a coefficient in a linear regression.

These linear regression weights provide, in some sense, the most precise estimate available given a conditioning set (and a linear model).
