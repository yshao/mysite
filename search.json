The “goal project” was creating self-assemblying nano-fabricators. The possibilities at creating a abundance society appealed to me.\nI had the fortune to work with a nobel prize winner in nanometerials, Shuji Nakamura, the inventor of blue LED, that summer was both fun and informative, as I found out how “wet” work is conducted in a fab room. I learned about van de pauw method of Hall effect measurement and a bit of crystal lattice structure.\nPaper\nFor my undergraduate design project. I invented a innovative apparatus and electrochemistry process to create material for the characterization of laser beam profile with high purity silver. (95% and above, grade above sterling silver, which is at ~93%)\nPaper\nThe silver helical target became part of the patent description in a laser characterization apparatus\nLink\nI was also a mentor in FIRST Robotics for Team 159 at Poudre High School. I was also a former participant in the robotics competition\nIt’s one of the formative influences that led to study engineering. We won the Chairman’s Award for profileration of STEM for the state of Colorado and was one of the early teams that made the presence significant for the FIRST committee to form the Colorado Regional.\nI’ve learned most about robotics here. The open-source hardware movement later made it cool to use arduino and rasp-pi.\nFIRST Website\nOn team 159, I did robot and motor controls, electronics and was the original webmaster. I learned also machine shop related skills with metal and plastic. The new website is much more organized today!\nTeam 159 Website\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{shao2022,\n  author = {Yuping Shao},\n  title = {Undergraduate},\n  date = {2022-05-18},\n  url = {https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/undergraduate},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYuping Shao. 2022. “Undergraduate.” May 18, 2022. https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/undergraduate."

Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.\nVisualization 1\nThe 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is fundamentally an inference and hard to get right\nVisualization 2"

This makes it relevant for interventional study.\nThis collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.\nTo train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition (published by CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.\nThe project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment."

    "text": "tidyhte\ntidyhte provides tidy semantics for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects through the use of Kennedy’s (n.d.) doubly-robust learner.\nThe goal of tidyhte is to use a sort of “recipe” design. This should (hopefully) make it extremely easy to scale an analysis of HTE from the common single-outcome / single-moderator case to many outcomes and many moderators. The configuration of tidyhte should make it extremely easy to perform the same analysis across many outcomes and for a wide-array of moderators. It’s written to be fairly easy to extend to different models and to add additional diagnostics and ways to output information from a set of HTE estimates.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n    \nregweight\nThe goal of regweight is to make it easy to diagnose a model using Aronow and Samii (2015) regression weights.\nIn short, these weights show which observations are most influential for determining the observed value of a coefficient in a linear regression. If the linear regression is aiming to estimate causal effects, this implies that the OLS estimand may differ from the average treatment effect. These linear regression weights provide, in some sense, the most precise estimate available given a conditioning set (and a linear model). These weights are in expectation the conditional variance of the variable of interest (given the other covariates in the model).\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package\n    \nrdd\nOutdated! Users should switch to actively maintained and updated RD tools.\nProvides the tools to undertake estimation in Regression Discontinuity Designs. Both sharp and fuzzy designs are supported. Estimation is accomplished using local linear regression. A provided function will utilize Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth calculation. A function is also included to test the assumption of no-sorting effects.\n\n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package"
