    "text": "Woodward\nhttps://www.woodward.com/en/shop/woodward44-gas-metering-and-shutoff\nRight before I moved to Boulder, I had a gig working in the renewable energy initiative in 2008 on energy/gas/oil/wind turbine controllers. I worked on two different projects, Falcon and Eagle. One is for liquid valve controller, the other is for gas. The facility at Fort Collins is both the design center as well as the manucturing plant. The part I remember was it had a giant lathe that is more than 10 feet tall to machine the turbine controller in one piece\nWebsite\n\n\nRadiometers and beyond\nRight before I moved to Boston, I wanted to do something about the environment after reading about the pollution in China back in 2012. So I worked at this place that builds miniaturized radiometer, a type of atmospheric sensing instrument, that is 10-15 years ahead of its competitions. The website they run shows the amazing science this place do.\nWebsite http://www.boulderest.com/\n\n\nClinical Data Animation Center - MGH\nWorking at CDAC is such an extraordinary opportunity. Working along side of biomedical analysts, machine learning engineers, clinicians, and clinical researchers, all of whom have data science training made it feasible to collaborate on some cool projects.\nSome of the talks and presentations I’ve made have focused toward covering fields that data scientists otherwise would not be as informed about: topics of system engineering, software engineering, and data engineering.\nMy CDAC presentations\nMany of the presentations have been done in conjunction with Manohar Ghanta, another data engineer/scientist currently working on big omics data\nSpark II - Big Data Analytics\nCDAC Workshop 1 - Streaming Timeseries\nCDAC Workshop 2 - Big Data Medical Informatics\nCDAC Workshop 3 - Multi-modal Fuzzy-matching and NLP\nCDAC Workshop 4 - AI Data Engineering\nMore recently, I’ve been leading the efforts to make an accurate simulator for clinical policy, it involves working with the clinical decision support operational group at MGH\nDigital Health part 1\nI work at Mass General Hospital Neurology Department in a clinical data analytics group (CDAC - clinical data animation center) with PI neurologist Dr. Brandon Westover where neurophysiology/computational neuroscience/clinical science intersect. Working at CDAC gave me the opportunity to interact with physicians, postdocs, and biomedical analysts with specialized knowledge of the dynamical system of the human brain physiology. To find machine learning/deep learning models that work well, it involves curation of data to get concept representations learned from clinical data, forming a database of metadata. This compositional data concept system can be harnessed to build machine learning algorithm for many detection and prediction of degenerative states of the brain physiology and medical informatics.\nMy typical projects involve wrangling multimodal data source ranging from waveforms like EEG/EKG, clinical timeseries like labs/vitals, sequentially updated physician notes, and prepare them into research ready data through data cleaning, interrogating data statistics, rule-based label harvesting, data pattern classification with models, and discovering data correlation through predictive modeling and data exploration.\nProjects I have been involved include but not limited to: Prediction of onset of sepsis with streaming electronics health records. Large scale visualization of spatio-temporal patterns from seizure burden data. Delirium predictive analytics on electronics health records. Big analytics on EEG processing. * Automated Surveillance for Ventilator Associated Events.\nEEG Report to Recordings Matching and Text Mining https://education.dellemc.com/content/dam/dell-emc/documents/en-us/2018KS_Tony-EEG_Report_to_Recordings_Matching_and_Text_Mining.pdf\nLarge Scale tSNE Map\nWorking at MGH is such an extraordinary opportunity. The CDAC group has what would be the largest database of EEG showing interesting seizure patterns. A book that was published based on this work is now on Amazon Book\nThe earliest attempt to curate 100 patients was pretty challenging, since there’s a lot of data variabilities. Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.\nVisualization 1\nThe 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is fundamentally an inference and hard to get right\nVisualization 2\nSepsis-onset Detection 25 november 2018 time-sensitive detection for near-time application\nPredictive algorithm becomes policy relevant what it’s also predicting the onset, not just the category. This makes it relevant for interventional study.\nThis collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.\nTo train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition (published by CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.\nThe project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment.\nGeorgiaTech Work\nfile://///ethan/newshare/GoogleDrive/website/Interactive%20Intelligence.mp4\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{shao2022,\n  author = {Yuping Shao},\n  title = {Work {Experience}},\n  date = {2022-05-18},\n  url = {https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/current-research},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYuping Shao. 2022. “Work Experience.” May 18, 2022. https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/current-research."

    "text": "Woodward\nhttps://www.woodward.com/en/shop/woodward44-gas-metering-and-shutoff\nRight before I moved to Boulder, I had a gig working in the renewable energy initiative in 2008 on energy/gas/oil/wind turbine controllers. I worked on two different projects, Falcon and Eagle. One is for liquid valve controller, the other is for gas. The facility at Fort Collins is both the design center as well as the manucturing plant. The part I remember was it had a giant lathe that is more than 10 feet tall to machine the turbine controller in one piece\nWebsite\n\n\nRadiometers and beyond\nRight before I moved to Boston, I wanted to do something about the environment after reading about the pollution in China back in 2012. So I worked at this place that builds miniaturized radiometer, a type of atmospheric sensing instrument, that is 10-15 years ahead of its competitions. The website they run shows the amazing science this place do.\nWebsite http://www.boulderest.com/\n\n\nClinical Data Animation Center - MGH\nWorking at CDAC is such an extraordinary opportunity. Working along side of biomedical analysts, machine learning engineers, clinicians, and clinical researchers, all of whom have data science training made it feasible to collaborate on some cool projects.\nSome of the talks and presentations I’ve made have focused toward covering fields that data scientists otherwise would not be as informed about: topics of system engineering, software engineering, and data engineering.\nMy CDAC presentations\nMany of the presentations have been done in conjunction with Manohar Ghanta, another data engineer/scientist currently working on big omics data\nSpark II - Big Data Analytics\nCDAC Workshop 1 - Streaming Timeseries\nCDAC Workshop 2 - Big Data Medical Informatics\nCDAC Workshop 3 - Multi-modal Fuzzy-matching and NLP\nCDAC Workshop 4 - AI Data Engineering\nMore recently, I’ve been leading the efforts to make an accurate simulator for clinical policy, it involves working with the clinical decision support operational group at MGH\nDigital Health part 1\nI work at Mass General Hospital Neurology Department in a clinical data analytics group (CDAC - clinical data animation center) with PI neurologist Dr. Brandon Westover where neurophysiology/computational neuroscience/clinical science intersect. Working at CDAC gave me the opportunity to interact with physicians, postdocs, and biomedical analysts with specialized knowledge of the dynamical system of the human brain physiology. To find machine learning/deep learning models that work well, it involves curation of data to get concept representations learned from clinical data, forming a database of metadata. This compositional data concept system can be harnessed to build machine learning algorithm for many detection and prediction of degenerative states of the brain physiology and medical informatics.\nMy typical projects involve wrangling multimodal data source ranging from waveforms like EEG/EKG, clinical timeseries like labs/vitals, sequentially updated physician notes, and prepare them into research ready data through data cleaning, interrogating data statistics, rule-based label harvesting, data pattern classification with models, and discovering data correlation through predictive modeling and data exploration.\nProjects I have been involved include but not limited to: Prediction of onset of sepsis with streaming electronics health records. Large scale visualization of spatio-temporal patterns from seizure burden data. Delirium predictive analytics on electronics health records. Big analytics on EEG processing. * Automated Surveillance for Ventilator Associated Events.\nEEG Report to Recordings Matching and Text Mining https://education.dellemc.com/content/dam/dell-emc/documents/en-us/2018KS_Tony-EEG_Report_to_Recordings_Matching_and_Text_Mining.pdf\nLarge Scale tSNE Map\nWorking at MGH is such an extraordinary opportunity. The CDAC group has what would be the largest database of EEG showing interesting seizure patterns. A book that was published based on this work is now on Amazon Book\nThe earliest attempt to curate 100 patients was pretty challenging, since there’s a lot of data variabilities. Data reduction and dimensional reduction techniques were needed to just get to the clustering stage for unsupervised learning.\nVisualization 1\nThe 2nd stage became a semi-supervised learning project with improved approaches to curate data. Still, data volume made the project hard. In the second, the features seem to have been over-engineered and constrained. The parametric approach is fundamentally an inference and hard to get right\nVisualization 2\nSepsis-onset Detection 25 november 2018 time-sensitive detection for near-time application\nPredictive algorithm becomes policy relevant what it’s also predicting the onset, not just the category. This makes it relevant for interventional study.\nThis collaboration investigates the deployment of sepsis onset detection within ICU. Sepsis is a common precursor to neurological disorders. The early detection of its onset could provide opportunity for intervention within ICU healthcare.\nTo train the deep learning algorithm for the detection, I prepared a cohort of 7800 patients found within ICU with sepsis condition as determined by the Sepsis-III definition (published by CDC). Then working with the clinical informatics group at Emory to develop a model that predicts the onset of sepsis.\nThe project introduces the importance of temporal context. For example, antibiotics medications are frequently given to patients within ICU, however, if antibiotics are given with certain number of times over 3 days when followed by microbiology culture test, then the medication was for sepsis treatment.\nGeorgiaTech Work\nfile://///ethan/newshare/GoogleDrive/website/Interactive%20Intelligence.mp4\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{shao2022,\n  author = {Yuping Shao},\n  title = {Work {Experience}},\n  date = {2022-05-18},\n  url = {https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/work-experience},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nYuping Shao. 2022. “Work Experience.” May 18, 2022. https://yshao.github.io/mysite//posts/work-experience."

This should (hopefully) make it extremely easy to scale an analysis of HTE from the common single-outcome / single-moderator case to many outcomes and many moderators. The configuration of tidyhte should make it extremely easy to perform the same analysis across many outcomes and for a wide-array of moderators. It’s written to be fairly easy to extend to different models and to add additional diagnostics and ways to output information from a set of HTE estimates.\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n    \nregweight\nThe goal of regweight is to make it easy to diagnose a model using Aronow and Samii (2015) regression weights.\nIn short, these weights show which observations are most influential for determining the observed value of a coefficient in a linear regression. If the linear regression is aiming to estimate causal effects, this implies that the OLS estimand may differ from the average treatment effect. These linear regression weights provide, in some sense, the most precise estimate available given a conditioning set (and a linear model). These weights are in expectation the conditional variance of the variable of interest (given the other covariates in the model).\n\n        \n        Website\n     \n        \n        Github\n     \n        \n        Package\n    \nrdd\nOutdated!
